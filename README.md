# Unsplash It Sketch Plugin

![Unsplash It Sketch Plugin Icon](/assets/icon_small.png?raw=true "Unsplash It Sketch Plugin Icon")

A plugin to quickly include great looking images from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) in your Sketch projects.
Because being able to quickly iterate on UI is important but also having great photography as placeholders is not that bad.


## Demo

### Updates
*1.4*
- Fixed all the compatibilty issues with Sketch 4.

*1.3*
- Switched to the Unsplash Source API.
- You can now specify tags, between square brackets, in the layer name. ( e.g. [bird, sea] ). If no image is available for the search tags you choose, you get a default image with "We coulnd' find that photo" on it.
- Removed options, since to blur and desaturate the image is fairly easy to do using default Sketch tools.

### Next iteration
- With the layer selected, being able to navigate to the picture page URL on Unsplash.
